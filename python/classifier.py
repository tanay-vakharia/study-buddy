Exercise 2: A basic Brain-Computer Interface
=============================================

Description:
In this second exercise, we will learn how to use an automatic algorithm to
recognize somebody's mental states from their EEG. We will use a classifier,
i.e., an algorithm that, provided some data, learns to recognize patterns,
and can then classify similar unseen information.
